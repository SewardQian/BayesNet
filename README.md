##Description of Files:

The tester is now available in the file student_test_a3.py: Test your implementation by placing this file in the same directory as your bnet.py implementation python3 student_test_a3.py Or if the default python on your system is already python3 you should be able to execute python student_test_a3.py Remember that if you pass all of the tests run by student_test_a3.py then you will obtain a passing mark in the assignment. If you fail all of these tests you will obtain a zero on the assignment.

To obtain full marks on the assignment your code will have to pass additional tests that will be run after your assignment has been submitted. These additional tests will check for more complex cases that your code should also be able to handle if you have correctly implemented it according to the assignment specification.

The assignment specification: a3.pdf

The Bayes Net supplied code bnet.py

Sample code specifying and solving some simple Bayes Nets example_bn.py and the master solution output from this code is in example_bn_output.txt

Another set of simple tests for your implementation. simple_net.py 
and the master solution output on these tests simple_net_output.txt
